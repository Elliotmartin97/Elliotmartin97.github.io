<h2>Real-time Raytraced Portals in DirectX12<h2>
<p>A real-time raytracer written in C++ using the DirectX12 framework featuring an experimental portal raytracing shader on three-dimensional objects. This project was used as the submission for my masters dissertation and was the culmination of 5 months research and work. The project also contains a Unity project used as both a level editor for the raytracer as well as a prototype for the portal effect.</p>
