<h2>Mesh cutting and fracturing in Unity<h2>
<p>This project includes a system that can dynamically cut or fracture a polygon mesh during runtime. It uses a set of parameters to determine a fracture, such as number of cuts and their angles. The system is fast when dealing with primative or small custom meshes, but struggles when dealing with large amounts of mesh data.</p>
