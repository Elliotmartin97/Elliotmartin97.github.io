<h2>A Procedural Plant and Tree Generator In DirectX11<h2>
<p>This project uses an L-system to generate plant and tree models using the DirectX11 framework along with running a python script to generate unique textures for the models. The models can exported with .OBJ and .MTL file formats as well as a .TXT file used to save and load the models inside the application.</p>
